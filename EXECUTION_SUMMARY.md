## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX

### Issue #1: Text Not Loading on First Load
**Current State**: Images appear before text
**Root Cause**: Unknown - fonts are already optimized
**Solution Steps**:
1. All components use `loading="eager"` for critical images ‚úÖ
2. Fonts have `display: 'swap'` configured ‚úÖ
3. Need to check for JavaScript dependencies blocking text render
4. Ensure all critical text is server-rendered

**To Test**:
- Open site in incognito mode
- Check if text appears immediately
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify font loading in Network tab

### Issue #2: Homepage Still Uses Old Hero
**Current State**: page.tsx imports `Hero` not `HeroNew`
**Solution**: Update src/app/page.tsx to import HeroNew

### Issue #3: Testimonials Component Not Updated
**Current State**: Still has old content
**Solution**: File needs to be recreated with new content

.section-gap { margin-top: 12rem; /* 192px */ }
.massive-gap { margin-top: 16rem; /* 256px */ }

/* No padding on main containers */
.full-bleed-container { padding: 0; }

/* Content within full-bleed */
.content-block { max-width: 80rem; margin: 0 auto; padding: 0 1.5rem; }
```

### Image Effects (To Implement)
```javascript
// Founder images: Grayscale ‚Üí Color on hover
<img 
  className="grayscale hover:grayscale-0 transition-all duration-700"
  style={{ filter: 'grayscale(100%)' }}
/>

<img 
  className="group-hover:scale-110 transition-transform duration-700"
/>
```

### Animation Consistency (Use Everywhere)
```javascript
// Left content
const leftAnimation = {
  initial: { opacity: 0, x: -50 },
  whileInView: { opacity: 1, x: 0 },
  transition: { duration: 0.6, ease: [0.22, 1, 0.36, 1] }
}

// Right content

}

  initial: { opacity: 0, y: 40 },
  whileInView: { opacity: 1, y: 0 },
