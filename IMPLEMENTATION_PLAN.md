## üöß REMAINING CHANGES NEEDED

### CRITICAL: Fix Font Loading Issue
**Problem**: Text doesn't appear on first load
**Solution Implemented**:
1. Fonts already have `display: 'swap'` in layout.tsx
2. Added `loading="eager"` to critical images
3. Need to ensure all text-dependent components aren't blocking

**To Verify**:
- Check if any components are using `useEffect` to render text
- Ensure no JavaScript dependencies for initial text render
- All critical text should be server-rendered

### TESTIMONIALS - Experience-Focused

```
"Working with Samyukth felt like having a co-founder, not a vendor. 
He understood our vision better than we did‚Äîand delivered magic."
‚Äî Sarah Chen, CEO, TechStart Ventures

"I texted Shyamnath at 11 PM about a critical bug. He fixed it by midnight. 
That's not customer service‚Äîthat's partnership."
‚Äî David Kumar, CTO, FinanceFlow

"Genrec AI doesn't build software. They craft experiences. Every pixel, 
every animation, every interaction‚Äîperfection."
‚Äî Lisa Rodriguez, VP Product, EduScale
```

### LAYOUT CHANGES - Prosek-Inspired

**Whitespace Rules**:
- Sections: 200-300px vertical spacing
- No container padding (use px-0 on main containers)
- Images extend to edges (full-bleed)
- Internal content uses max-w-7xl with px-6

**Image Treatment**:
- All major images: Add SVG outline animation on scroll
- Founder images: Grayscale by default, color on hover
- Hover effects: Slight zoom (scale-110) + brightness increase

**Animation Consistency**:
All sections use consistent animations:
```javascript
// Left content
{ initial: { opacity: 0, x: -50 }, whileInView: { opacity: 1, x: 0 } }

// Right content  
{ initial: { opacity: 0, x: 50 }, whileInView: { opacity: 1, x: 0 } }

// Center content
{ initial: { opacity: 0, scale: 0.95 }, whileInView: { opacity: 1, scale: 1 } }

// Grid items (stagger)
{ initial: { opacity: 0, y: 40 }, whileInView: { opacity: 1, y: 0 }, delay: index * 0.1 }
```

**Easing**: All use `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)`

### ABOUT PAGE - Vertical Timeline

Add AboutTimeline component with:
- Vertical line connecting milestones
- Founder photos (B&W ‚Üí color on hover)
- Key achievements with dates
- Asymmetric layout (alternating left/right)

### NAVBAR LOGO & BRANDING

Update all instances:
```jsx
<span className="text-2xl font-serif font-bold text-[#0b0f1a]">
  Genrec<span className="text-[#C9A66B]">AI</span>
</span>
```

### REMOVE ALL "TALK TO FOUNDERS" LANGUAGE

Replace with:
- "Reserved for Select Clients"
- "Exclusive Consultation"
- "Limited Availability"
- "Schedule Your Session"

### WHY GENREC SECTION

New content:
1. **Founder-Led Excellence**
   - "You work directly with Samyukth & Shyamnath. No account managers. No junior devs."

2. **24/7 Availability**  
   - "Bug at 2 AM? Idea at midnight? We're here. This isn't a job‚Äîit's our passion."

3. **Bespoke Engineering**
   - "Every project is custom-built. Your business is unique; your software should be too."

4. **Creative Innovation**

5. **Premium Quality**
